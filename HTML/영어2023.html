        <div class="esg-subtitle">Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions</div>
        <p>
            NewOne strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated in daily operations. All employees work to minimize direct emissions from logistics vehicles and electricity usage.
        </p>

        <h4>Logistics Vehicles</h4>
        <p>
            To minimize emissions, electric vehicles are introduced for material distribution. One corporate vehicle was replaced with an electric car, and two old internal combustion vehicles were replaced with high-efficiency models.
        </p>

        <div class="esg-img">
            <img src="https://ml7h6bxvg0ll.i.optimole.com/w:719/h:296/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.newonetotal.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/%EC%A0%84%EA%B8%B0%EC%B0%A8-%EA%B5%90%EC%B2%B4.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
            Employees also practice fuel-efficient driving through safety training: maintaining steady speeds, regular vehicle maintenance, and using public transport. Carpooling during scheduled visits further reduces energy consumption.
        </p>

        <div class="esg-img">
            <img src="https://ml7h6bxvg0ll.i.optimole.com/w:467/h:191/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.newonetotal.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/%EC%B9%B4%ED%92%80.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
            NewOne continuously seeks ways to efficiently use resources and reduce costs to minimize environmental impact. Employees perform eco-friendly operations to limit environmental effects on stakeholders.
        </p>

        <h4>Electricity</h4>
        <p>
            NewOne minimizes electricity usage by upgrading to high-efficiency appliances and replacing all office lighting with LEDs. Power is cut off outside working hours, and appropriate temperature management reduces HVAC energy consumption.
        </p>

        <div class="esg-img">
            <img src="https://ml7h6bxvg0ll.i.optimole.com/w:467/h:190/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.newonetotal.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/%EC%A1%B0%EB%AA%85%EA%B5%90%EC%B2%B4.png" alt="">

        </div>

        <p>
            Through these initiatives, greenhouse gas emissions per revenue unit from logistics vehicles exceeded the target (5% reduction from previous year). Overall emissions slightly increased due to electricity use, but total emissions exceeded the target by 2.5%.
        </p>

        <p>
            Employees voluntarily participate in greenhouse gas reduction activities and continue to integrate energy-saving practices into daily operations.

        <div class="esg-subtitle">Waste Reduction and Resource Recycling</div>
        <p>
            Preventing environmental pollution is a key corporate responsibility. Since April 2023, NewOne has enforced environmental regulations and reduced various wastes in the distribution process through recycling initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Packaging optimization and reuse efforts minimize material usage. Packaging materials are also collected and reused in transportation.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            As a result, the goal of reducing packaging usage per revenue by 10% was achieved, and ongoing efforts will continue.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were no environmental incidents or regulatory violations in 2023, and compliance will continue.

        <div class="esg-subtitle">Promotion of Smart Service Support Projects</div>
        <p>
            In 2021, NewOne participated in the Smart Service Support Project led by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, establishing an automated RPA system for outbound operations. RPA automated repetitive tasks, reducing errors, saving time, and reducing electricity and paper usage.

        <p>
            NewOne aims to minimize waste from leftover inventory by offering storage services for surplus stock after site construction. The company will properly store surplus items, share inventory status with clients, and resell items that cannot be reused.
        </p>
        <div class="esg-img">

        </div>
        <p>
            Systems to support surplus inventory management will also be built to minimize waste and contribute to environmental improvement while maintaining high profitability.

            NewOne enhances the quality of jobs and provides tailored training opportunities to support employee growth, keeping pace with continuous business expansion.
        </p>
        <h4>Enhancing Job Quality</h4>
        <p>
            Embracing the motto of growing together with employees, NewOne restructured its workforce to consist entirely of regular employees instead of the previous mix of regular and contract positions.  
            The company also increased the recruitment of female talent, strategically placing employees in outbound and inbound marketing roles. This has contributed to sustained sales growth from both sides.

        <h4>Tailored Job Training</h4>
        <p>
            Beyond mandatory training, NewOne actively implements role-specific training programs to enhance employee capabilities and foster growth.  
            By increasing training time and budgets by over 14% compared to the previous year, employees’ professional growth and job satisfaction have improved.  
            Streamlining work through digitalization has further reduced workload, increased efficiency and productivity, and strengthened employees’ sense of pride.

        <p>
            During the 2023 Chuseok holiday, all employees participated in donating 1 million KRW in gift certificates to “Subong Rehabilitation Center,” a local educational facility for people with disabilities.  
            Moving forward, NewOne will continue participating in programs that contribute to the development of the community in collaboration with various local social welfare organizations.

        <h4>Creation of Local Employment</h4>

            In October, NewOne participated in the Suwon City Job Fair to introduce the company to local young job seekers, resulting in the recruitment of five new full-time employees.  
            The company will continue actively creating quality job opportunities to secure local talent in the future.

            NewOne believes that creating a healthy and comfortable workplace is the foundation of ESG activities. The company strictly adheres to occupational safety regulations and strengthens health initiatives to ensure a safe and healthy working environment.
        </p>
        <h4>ISO45001 Certification and Safety Awareness</h4>
        <p>
            To prevent serious accidents and take proactive measures, NewOne established an Occupational Health and Safety Management System and obtained ISO45001 certification in April 2023.  
            Employees undergo safety and fire management training, and safety posters are displayed in work areas to reinforce safety awareness.

        <h4>Accident Prevention and Medical Support</h4>
        <p>
            As a distributor of electrical, telecommunication, and fire equipment, employee injuries mainly occur during the handling, loading, and unloading of products.  
            NewOne strictly enforces safety and health guidelines on-site, reducing the accident rate from 55.6% to 9.1% compared to the previous year, marking significant progress toward a zero-accident workplace.
        </p>

        <p>
            In case of unforeseen accidents, the company not only covers industrial accident insurance but also provides medical support through a dedicated fund, contributing 500,000 KRW per month (6 million KRW annually) since 2021.  
            From 2024, the health checkup program, previously for employees only, will be extended to their families.

        <p>
            To improve customer satisfaction and corporate credibility, NewOne implements detailed management plans to minimize defective product purchases, order errors, and faulty shipments, thereby reducing returns and customer inconvenience.
        </p>

        <h4>Strengthening Quality through Purchase-to-Shipment Process Improvement</h4>
        <p>
            The company reorganized the purchase-to-shipment process to prevent defective product purchases, shipment errors, and order mistakes that lead to returns and waste.  
            Each stage clearly defines the responsibilities of the sales and logistics teams, ensuring all members carry out their duties responsibly.

        </div>

        <h4>Return Process Reestablishment and Data Management</h4>
        <p>
            Return reasons are categorized into client requests, invoice errors, purchase mistakes, and supplier defects.  
            The sales team verifies the reason for each return, inputs it into the system, and ensures the return process is correctly followed.  
            By continuously monitoring return causes, NewOne quickly identifies increases due to new product lines, updates product manuals, and hires additional staff to ensure thorough verification from purchase to shipment.

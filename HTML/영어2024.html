        <h1 class="esg-title">ESG Management Goals</h1>
        <p>
            In 2023, NewOne established an ESG strategic framework focused on an ESG action plan that aligns with the
            company's mission and enables tangible results in sustainable management. In 2024, this framework has been
            further enhanced as a strategy to achieve sustainable growth and satisfy both internal and external
            customers.

            <div class="esg-subtitle">Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</div>
            <p>
                Newon is making multifaceted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated during daily business
                operations.
                In particular, the company is striving to decrease both direct emissions from logistics vehicles and
                indirect emissions
                resulting from electricity use, with all employees participating in the achievement of these
                environmental goals.
                Newon aims to strengthen its greenhouse gas reduction activities and foster a responsible corporate
                culture for a sustainable future.
            </p>

            <h4>Logistics Vehicles</h4>
            <p>
                To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote eco-friendly management, Newon is gradually replacing its
                logistics fleet
                with high-efficiency and eco-friendly vehicles. The company has transitioned corporate vehicles to
                electric models,
                replaced old vehicles with fuel-efficient ones, and leased hybrid cars for business use to enhance
                energy efficiency.
                These efforts have significantly reduced carbon emissions during transportation and maximized energy
                savings.
            </p>

            <div class="esg-img">
                <img src="https://ml7h6bxvg0ll.i.optimole.com/w:347/h:237/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.newonetotal.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/%EA%B7%B8%EB%A6%BC-6-1-%EC%A0%84%EA%B8%B0%EC%B0%A8-%EA%B5%90%EC%B2%B4.jpg"

                    alt="">
            </div>

            <p>
                In addition, Newon improves fuel efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions through safe driving
                education
                and consistent-speed driving practices. Regular vehicle maintenance, promotion of public transportation,
                and encouragement
                of carpooling further minimize energy consumption during logistics operations, contributing to the
                company’s commitment
                to a sustainable environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Newon actively promotes strategies that enhance resource efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
                through cost savings.
                Employees make environmentally conscious decisions in their daily tasks and perform their duties in
                sustainable and eco-friendly ways,
                fulfilling their environmental responsibilities. Through this approach, Newon aims to create a positive
                environmental impact for its stakeholders
                and position itself as a leading company driving change toward a more sustainable future.
            </p>

            <div class="esg-text">
                <p>
                    Newon is taking various measures to reduce electricity consumption and improve energy efficiency.
                    The company has introduced high-efficiency appliances and replaced all lighting with LEDs,
                    significantly reducing energy use related to lighting. These initiatives have contributed
                    to lowering power costs and minimizing environmental impact.

                consumers,
                the company aims to promote resource circulation as well as sustainable consumption and production.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, the surplus material recycling platform allows users to directly register surplus items
                left at construction sites,
                or to exchange or sell materials with other users who need them.
                This platform plays a key role in reducing industrial waste and promoting resource circulation, thereby
                contributing to environmental protection.

                <p>
                    Newon is preparing to transform its current business from electrical machinery and equipment
                    wholesale (Industry Code 46595)
                    into electronic sensing equipment manufacturing (Industry Code 26294), which includes harmful gas
                    measurement devices, filtration systems, malfunction detection instruments, and smart medical
                    robots.
                    To support this transition, the company opened a manufacturing plant at 53 Jeonpa-ro, Manan-gu,
                    Anyang in May 2024,
                    where products manufactured by outsourcing partners are packaged and shipped.
                    Additionally, Newon plans to upgrade its existing R&D department into a certified corporate research
                    institute by 2025 and internalize its manufacturing technologies alongside the new factory
                    facilities scheduled for completion in May 2025.
                    Through this effort, the company aims to achieve sustainable regional growth, enhance corporate
                    value, and contribute to the community as a leading environmental equipment manufacturer.

            <p>
                In 2024, Newon secured a new logistics warehouse and advanced factory site in the Baeyang-dong area of
                Hwaseong City,
                laying the foundation for its leap forward as a strong and innovative SME through the construction of a
                new headquarters and factory.
                The new facility, planned on a 1,800-pyeong (approximately 5,950 m²) site, will feature an integrated
                O4O (Online for Offline) total distribution system,
                a surplus material recycling platform (MRS: Material Recycling System), and smart business and
                environmental infrastructure such as hazardous material detection and exhaust systems.
                In addition, various eco-friendly facilities—including solar panels, LED lighting, and EV charging
                stations—will be introduced to promote energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction.
                The entire facility will be operated as an environmentally friendly system that prioritizes quality,
                safety, and sustainability.
                Furthermore, employee welfare and well-being will be enhanced through on-site amenities such as a

            <p>
                Through the establishment of its new logistics warehouse and factory,
                Newon aims to diversify its operations from offline-centered distribution to an O4O distribution model,
                transforming from a general distribution business into a manufacturing and eco-friendly platform
                enterprise
                that produces sustainable products and provides surplus material recycling services.
                Through these efforts, Newon will accelerate the achievement of its “Vision 2028” goals and continue
                striving for sustainable growth.

        A company cannot grow without the support of diverse stakeholders within its community. Therefore, a responsible corporation should actively communicate with its stakeholders and pursue social value beyond mere profit generation. Such efforts contribute positively to the broader society and serve as a foundation for sustainable business growth.

        Newon fulfills its social responsibilities by actively participating in programs that contribute to the environment, employment, and economic development of local communities—thereby putting its commitment to social responsibility management into practice.

The quality management system is an enterprise-wide management approach led by top management, in which all members participate in every aspect of business activities — from planning and design to purchasing, production, delivery, and service — to meet customer requirements, ensure satisfaction, and maintain quality. Through this system, Newone strives to provide the best products and services to its customers.

    <h4>Smart Factory Consulting</h4>
    <p>
        Since 2023, Newone has been expanding into the field of manufacturing environmental equipment required in semiconductor production. To enhance efficiency, productivity, and customer satisfaction across all stages — from design and development to manufacturing, logistics, and distribution — Newone is working to establish a smart factory that integrates information and communication technology (ICT). Through digital transformation (DX) consulting, the company has analyzed its current smart factory maturity level and is reinforcing infrastructure in stages based on the diagnostic results.

    </div>

    <p>
        Diagnostic results showed that Newone’s smart factory level — previously focused solely on distribution — was at Level 1 (the initial stage on a five-level scale). Leadership, strategy, and logistics operations were relatively strong, whereas product development, production planning, process control, quality management, information systems, equipment automation, and performance areas were weaker.

    </div>

    <p>
        Based on the analysis, Newone is expanding the scope of its current ERP system in the information systems domain and promoting the introduction of MES and SCM expansion, as well as the enhancement of data infrastructure for proactive management of customer complaint risks. Through continuous advancement across these areas, the company aims to achieve Level 3 smart factory maturity in the long term.

    <p>
        To embody its management philosophy of becoming a trusted company and a great place to work, Newone is assessing its current organizational culture and laying the foundation for a healthy culture that matches its external growth.
    </p>

    <h4>Internal Satisfaction Survey</h4>
    <p>
        To identify satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors among employees and develop effective solutions for organizational revitalization, Newone conducted a satisfaction survey across seven categories and twenty-one items covering overall HR systems and company operations.
    </p>

    <div class="esg-img">
        <img src="https://ml7h6bxvg0ll.i.optimole.com/w:221/h:246/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.newonetotal.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7-2025-06-10-170906.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <h4>Survey Results</h4>
    <p>
        The overall organizational culture satisfaction score was 81.0, slightly above the average level (80). Company satisfaction (83.4) and communication (83.1) scored higher, while HR systems (78.1) and knowledge management (79.0) were relatively lower. Overall, employee satisfaction with the company was favorable, but there is a need to strengthen HR development to support self-improvement and career growth through better working conditions and training programs.

    </div>

    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        Employees expressed satisfaction with the organization’s culture of shared growth and collaboration. However, they also desire more practical communication, clearer role distribution, and a structured job framework. Providing defined career paths and diverse growth opportunities will foster mutual development between individuals and the organization — an essential foundation for sustainable growth.

    <h4>Review of ESG Implementation Activities</h4>

        In January, Newon established its ESG activity plan, and in February, developed draft ESG performance indicators.  
        After internal discussion and agreement, the company finalized its 2024 ESG KPI metrics.  
        Considering the opening of its new manufacturing plant, Newon newly established “Environmental Business Infrastructure Development” as a key strategic initiative under the Environmental Management category.  
        In the Innovation Management category, “Employee Children’s Tuition Support” was newly added under the Employment Practices KPI,  
        setting higher standards and goals than in the previous year.

    <h4>Establishing ESG Management</h4>
    <p>
        While 2023 focused on announcing and laying the foundation for ESG management,  
        2024 was a year of tangible progress and implementation.  
        As a result, all employees worked to achieve 15 KPI goals aligned with the eight ESG strategic areas established for 2024.  
        With the company’s diversification from distribution to manufacturing,  
        Newon newly incorporated “Environmental Business Infrastructure Development” into its strategic initiatives,  
        obtaining ISO certification for quality management and applying for environmental technology patents.  
        In addition, the company enhanced its employment practices by introducing programs such as tuition support for employees’ children.  
        Through these efforts, Newon is solidifying ESG management and will continue to advance ESG initiatives in 2025  
        through key projects such as the relocation to its new factory.
    </p>
    <h4>Publication and Distribution of ESG Sustainability Reports</h4>
    <p>
        Marking its third year of ESG management, Newon published its second Sustainability Report in 2024, following its first in 2023.  
        The 2024 report highlights not only the results of the company’s eight ESG strategic tasks but also introduces the meaningful “2024 Newon 7 Highlights.”  
        By sharing this report with clients, partners, employees, and local communities,  
        Newon continues to promote its transparent and trustworthy management philosophy,

        To promote fair and transparent management and a sound organizational culture,  
        Newon established a Code of Ethics in 2023.  
        Since then, employees have actively participated in practicing ethical management.  
        In 2024, two ethics training sessions were held in April and November.  
        Various ethics programs are being implemented to ensure that Newon’s mission—“to be a company trusted by everyone”—  
        is not merely a slogan but a principle embedded across all corporate activities.

    </p>

    <h4>2024 ESG Management Pledge</h4>
    <p>
        In line with social expectations for fairness and transparency,  
        Newon incorporated ethical values into its decision-making by enacting its Code of Conduct last year.  
        Regular ethics training sessions have since been conducted to ensure active employee participation in upholding the code.  
        The 2024 Management Pledge also included mock exercises on unethical scenarios to strengthen awareness and engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
        In April and November 2024, Newon held two ethics training sessions for employees,  
        with the second session—featuring AI-based ethics training—drawing significant attention.  
        The company also presented its ethical management practices to clients,  
        helping to prevent ethical issues in business relationships and fostering a fair trade culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2025, Newon plans to continue promoting ethical management by establishing risk management guidelines  
        and recognizing exemplary “Integrity Newon Employees” (tentative title) through awards and acknowledgments.

    <div class="esg-header">(Vision 2028: KRW 100 Billion in Sales, KOSDAQ Listing, Gyeonggi-do Small Giants)</div>
    <p>
        In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, digital transformation (DX) is not an option but an essential management innovation  
        for strengthening corporate competitiveness and achieving sustainable growth.  
        Under its strategic goal to achieve “Vision 2028,” Newon recognized the need for DX advancement  
        in both manufacturing and marketing sectors and, with support from the Gyeonggi-do Economic Science Promotion Agency,  
        established DX-based growth strategies and implementation plans.  
        The company continues to accelerate digital innovation through structured execution and phased objectives.
    </p>

    <h4>Background of DX Implementation</h4>
    <p>
        Newon initiated DX to establish a foundation for continuous growth through digital innovation,  
        enhance ERP utilization, and advance its organizational operation system with detailed action plans across core areas.

    <h4>DX Implementation Strategy</h4>
    <p>
        Through digital transformation, Newon is reshaping work processes and establishing long-term business models.  
        Annual DX tasks were defined to materialize these strategies, ensuring a structured and efficient approach.  
        For successful DX execution, Newon established mid- to long-term goals and plans for business models,  
        customer experience, operational processes, and DX implementation systems.  
        This approach enables the company to continuously strengthen its digital capabilities and enhance competitiveness  
        through phased and actionable initiatives.

    <p>
        Through comprehensive analysis—including stakeholder interviews and process assessments—  
        Newon derived five key DX strategies:  
        ① Establishment of a data-driven management foundation,  
        ② Development of an online platform system,  
        ③ Digitalization and advancement of processes,  
        ④ Activation of a digital organizational culture, and  
        ⑤ Establishment of a DX execution framework.  
        These initiatives aim to systematically promote digital transformation and enhance corporate competitiveness.
    </p>
    <h4>Marketing DX</h4>
    <p>
        Based on SWOT analysis, Newon identified three major Marketing DX improvement tasks:
